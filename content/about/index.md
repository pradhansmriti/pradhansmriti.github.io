I am a PhD candidate in Physics with a strong background in computational modeling, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. My academic journey began with a fascination for mathematics and problem solving, which evolved into applying advanced computational methods to understand complex systems.

For my Bachelor’s and Master’s thesis, I developed Monte Carlo simulations for ant traffic flow models and applied stochastic models like Fokker–Planck equations to study collective decision-making in ant colonies. These projects helped me develop a passion for using computational methods to analyze emergent behaviors.

During my PhD, I have focused on one of nature’s most robust complex systems: viruses. Using machine learning-driven coarse graining, I have applied enhanced sampling, Markov state models, and Monte Carlo simulations to extract insights from large-scale simulations. Through my PhD research, I have gained experience in building scalable computational approaches and applying them to diverse challenges in complex systems.

I enjoy learning new methods and applying them to challenging problems. I am currently seeking industry roles starting in January 2026 where I can continue to grow as a researcher and problem solver.
