Hi! I'm Smriti Pradhan, a PhD candidate in Physics at **Brandeis University** working with Prof. Michael.F.Hagan. My research primarily focuses on using coarse-grained simulation techniques to understand the assembly of Hepatits B Virus and how it's impeded in the presence of Core-protein Allosteric Modulators (CpAMs).


I did my undergrad and masters in Physics at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. For my master's thesis research I worked with Prof. Debashish Chowdhury to understand the stochastic process of decision-making and traffic management in ant colonies.

In my free time I love experimenting with new recipes, learning new crafts, reading and napping.
