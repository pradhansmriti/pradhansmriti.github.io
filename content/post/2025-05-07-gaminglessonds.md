So one of the biggest reason that I'm a strictly computational scientist is my extremely shaky hands and general propensity to drop things. I think the most challenging course for me was my second year Optics lab course at IITK. I cannot count the number of times I almost broke during down lab because I couldn't align the lenses properly. I think the weeks working on Michaelson Interferometer where one of the most difficult weeks of my life. To Prof. Saikat Ghosh my instructor, and Smit Choudhay my labmate if you ever come across my blog I owe you me passing that course. Hence, began a hate relationship with experiments. Luckily for me, I loved math which meant I did not have to give up my dreams of becoming a physicist. So for the next decade or so I kept a healthy distance from anything that required finesse of hand movements. But there always remained a part of me that wanted to be able to handle tasks that required hand-eye coordination.
So for the year 2025 one of my new-year resolutions was learning gaming. Now the level of correlation between gaming and
