For anyone who knows me absolute lack of hand-eye coordination is pretty obvious. One of the reason that I'm a strictly computational scientist is my extremely shaky hands and general propensity to drop things. I think the most challenging course for me was my second year Optics lab course at IITK. I cannot count the number of times I almost broke during lab because I couldn't align the lenses properly. You see it all started when I was 15 and I had a terrible that left me losing half of my left elbow movement. I also lost sensation in two of my left hand fingers for a while. I like to think that might be the reason why. It can also be a slowed reflex system for whatever reason.
