I have a confession to make. This website has been in the development stage for more than a year. I have had a layout ready this whole time. I figured out how to make Hugo work to my liking for months. But the "rate determining step" has been my apprehension to write that first post.
 
I have never written a blog post, countless dear diary entries sure but I haven't ever put my partially cooked thoughts out on the internet before. And when I say that I mean I am one of those quite internet lurkers. Upon some self reflection I have realized a couple of reasons for this. The first one is I never thought I was interesting enough. I don't like saying something when I believe I'm not bringing anything new to the conversation. I believed in a world where almost everyone shares their opinions on everything, my perspective was not unique. Maybe that's still true but as a true 21st century human I have to try shouting my thoughts at the internet void anyway. The other reason was I'm a perfectionist, it's a problem but I hate making mistakes. And English is my third language, so that means making lots of grammatical mistakes. As a sidenote if you spot any let me know! I'm trying not to use ChatGPT and using this as a writing exercise. And this lack of fluency made me even more nervous about blogging. 

But now I've finally talked myself into taking this momentous first step. I'm "git commiting" this to blog post. This is an exercise to fight my inner demons. Maybe somebody reads it and says "Wow Smriti your English sucks and your thoughts unoriginal". But maybe they are not, maybe I help someone see a problem from my perspective. So this time for sure I'm pushing that button and posting my first blopost ever!
If anyone ever reads this I would love to get some feedback!
