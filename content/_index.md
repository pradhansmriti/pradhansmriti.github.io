Hi, I'm Smriti Pradhan a PhD student in Physics, working at the interface of biology,chemistry and physics to udnerstand virus assmebly using computational methods. All my projects although quite different have had a common denominator of the objective of understanding complex systems. I love gaining and teaching myself new technical skills to solve exciting problems. I'm looking for positions in biotech/pharma,fintech and other industries where I can work at the interface of muliple fields to work on fun problems. You can me reach me at smritipradhan98@gmail.com or through linkedin.
