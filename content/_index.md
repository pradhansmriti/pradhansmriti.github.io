## Projects
Most recent projects:
- <span style="color: #ffc7ec;">*Kinetic monte carlo simulations for HBV*:</span> Part of my PhD thesis has involved working on understanding effect of different drug on HBV assembly using coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. [(Code)](https://github.com/pradhansmriti/hbv_dimerdrug)
- [<span style="color: #ffc7ec;">*Elastic network model for HBV assembly*</span>](https://github.com/pradhansmriti/HBV_enm)
