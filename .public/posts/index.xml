      <description>I work on developing coarse-grained models for Virus self assembly, which involves a few steps in the modelling process.
Develop a coarse-grained model. The more you can reduce the dimensionality the better. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be so coarse-grained that the results are abstract and cannot be compared with experiments at all. All-atom simulations can be great for </description>

      <description>A little bit about me Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a second year Physics Ph.D. student at Brandeis University. My reserach interests include using computational methods to understand the self-assembly of viruses. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on using coarse-grained methods to understand the assembly of HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) and how interactions with drug molecules chnages this assembly. To find out more about research interests and projects go here: .</description>
