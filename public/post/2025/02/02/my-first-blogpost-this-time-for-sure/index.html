<p>I have a confession to make. This website has been in the development stage for more than a year. I have had a layout ready this whole time. I figured out how to make Hugo work to my liking for months. But the &ldquo;rate determining step&rdquo; has been my apprehension to write that first post.</p>
<p>I have never written a blog post, countless dear diary entries sure but I haven&rsquo;t ever put my partially cooked thoughts out on the internet before. And when I say that I mean I am one of those quite internet lurkers. Upon some self reflection I have realized a couple of reasons for this. The first one is I never thought I was interesting enough. I don&rsquo;t like saying something when I believe I&rsquo;m not bringing anything new to the conversation. I believed in a world where almost everyone shares their opinions on everything, my perspective was not unique. Maybe that&rsquo;s still true but as a true 21st century human I have to try shouting my thoughts at the internet void anyway. The other reason was I&rsquo;m a perfectionist, it&rsquo;s a problem but I hate making mistakes. And English is my third language, so that means making lots of grammatical mistakes. As a sidenote if you spot any let me know! I&rsquo;m trying not to use ChatGPT and using this as a writing exercise. And this lack of fluency made me even more nervous about blogging.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;ve finally talked myself into taking this momentous first step. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;git commiting&rdquo; this to blog post. This is an exercise to fight my inner demons. Maybe somebody reads it and says &ldquo;Wow Smriti your English sucks and your thoughts unoriginal&rdquo;. But maybe they are not, maybe I help someone see a problem from my perspective. So this time for sure I&rsquo;m pushing that button and posting my first blopost ever!
If anyone ever reads this I would love to get some feedback!</p>
